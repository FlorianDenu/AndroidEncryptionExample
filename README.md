Android Encryption Example
========================

This is a basic example of using RSA and AES encryption in Android.  This example encrypts an inputted string using 
AES and then encrypts the AES key using RSA.  The AES encryption methods use streams and can be modified to handle 
data of arbitrary sizes.  The examples provided use AES Counter (CTR) and Electronic codebook (ECB).
